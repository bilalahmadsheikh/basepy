BasePy SDK - Comprehensive Project Documentation
================================================

1. Project Mission & Impact
---------------------------
**Mission:** To make the Base blockchain the most accessible Layer 2 network for Python developers.
**Impact:** 
- **Ecosystem Expansion:** Opens Base to the Python community (AI, Data Science, Backend).
- **Developer Experience:** Reduces setup time from hours to minutes.
- **Standardization:** Provides a secure, standard way to interact with Base.

2. Base Integration Specifics
-----------------------------
This project is not generic; it is tailored for Base:
- **Chain Identity:** Hardcoded Chain IDs for Mainnet (8453) and Sepolia (84532).
- **Network Access:** Pre-configured RPC URLs (e.g., `https://mainnet.base.org`).
- **Gas Logic:** (Future Phase) Optimized gas estimation for L2 rollups.

3. Detailed Feature Breakdown
-----------------------------

### A. Core Connectivity (`basepy/client.py`)
The heart of the SDK.
- **`BaseClient` Class:** The main entry point.
- **Auto-Connection:** Automatically cycles through a list of known, public Base RPC nodes until it finds a working one.
- **Network Awareness:** Knows the difference between Mainnet and Testnet instantly.
- **Methods:**
  - `get_chain_id()`: Verifies you are on the right network.
  - `get_block_number()`: Checks the latest sync status.
  - `get_balance(address)`: Checks native ETH balance.

### B. Wallet & Security (`basepy/wallet.py`)
Secure key management.
- **`Wallet` Class:** Represents a user's identity.
- **Creation:** `Wallet.create()` generates a brand new, cryptographically secure private key.
- **Importing:** 
  - `from_private_key()`: Load existing keys.
  - `from_mnemonic()`: Load from a 12/24 word seed phrase (BIP-39).
- **Signing:** Securely signs transactions locally (offline) before broadcasting, ensuring private keys never leave the device.

### C. Transaction Engine (`basepy/transactions.py`)
Simplified value transfer.
- **`Transactions` Class:** Handles the complexity of moving assets.
- **Native ETH:** `send_eth()` handles value conversion (Ether -> Wei), gas price fetching, nonce calculation, signing, and broadcasting in one step.
- **ERC-20 Tokens:** `send_erc20()` abstracts the complexity of token contracts. You just need the token address and amount; the SDK handles the ABI and function calls.

### D. Smart Contract Interface (`basepy/contracts.py`)
Interaction with decentralized applications.
- **`Contract` Class:** A wrapper for any deployed code on Base.
- **Read Operations:** `call()` allows fetching data (prices, balances, state) without paying gas.
- **Write Operations:** `transact()` allows changing state (swapping, voting, minting). It automatically estimates the required gas and manages the transaction lifecycle.

### E. Standard Wrappers (`basepy/standards.py`) [NEW]
Plug-and-play token interaction.
- **`ERC20` Class:** A ready-to-use wrapper for any ERC-20 token (USDC, WETH, DEGEN).
- **Built-in ABI:** The SDK includes the standard interface, so you don't need to copy-paste JSON files.
- **Methods:** `balance_of(address)`, `transfer(to, amount)`, `approve(spender, amount)`.

### F. Advanced Gas Logic (`basepy/client.py`) [NEW]
Optimized for Layer 2.
- **L1 Fee Calculation:** Base transactions pay a tiny fee to Ethereum (L1) for security.
- **`get_l1_fee(data)`:** Queries the Base Gas Price Oracle (Predeploy 0x4200...0F) to calculate this fee accurately.
- **Benefit:** Prevents under-priced transactions and provides users with accurate cost estimates.

### G. Utilities & Constants (`basepy/utils.py`)
The "Base DNA".
- **Constants:** Stores the critical configuration data for Base.
- **Helpers:** `to_wei`, `from_wei`, `is_address` make handling blockchain data types (which can be tricky in Python) straightforward.
- **Exceptions:** Custom error handling (`ConnectionError`, `WalletError`) to give developers clear feedback when things go wrong.

4. Why This "Improves" Base
---------------------------
A blockchain is a platform. Like an operating system, it needs good apps. Good apps need developers. Developers need good tools.
- **Before BasePy:** Python devs had to build their own tools from scratch to use Base.
- **After BasePy:** Python devs have a "standard library" for Base.
- **Result:** This accelerates the adoption of Base by removing friction for a massive demographic of developers.
